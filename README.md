# BCI REACT VER


### This will be a recreation of [BCI's](https://www.bestcircuits.com/) HTML multi-page website as a react single-page website. I will include some changes to layout, remove typos and add mobile responsiveness.

## Notes

I've noticed some redundancies in layout such as: the search function - rather than being an addition to the NavBar - is a distinct page, and the Contact Us and Feedback page can be combined cleanly.

There are (in my opinion) some issues with accidental inclusions, grammar, and phrasing. 

Global - The steel diamond pattern seems like its missing the mark somehow. 

Home - Margin-Top on "home" bar , "... is to" -> "... to".

Services - "posses", "are able  to", redundant hyperlink in final paragraph,  "...engineer: ```<mailto>Design_quote</mailto>```", button placement

Products - "\\", "tu", random spaces

Search - Margin-Top on header image, function doesn't work?, does it need to be its own separate page?

Contact/Feedback - I think it can be one page
