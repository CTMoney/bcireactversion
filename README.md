# BCI REACT VER


### This will be a recreation of [BCI's](https://www.bestcircuits.com/) HTML multi-page website as a react single-page website. I will include some changes to layout, remove typos and add mobile responsiveness.

## Notes
```
I've noticed some redundancies in layout such as: the search function - rather than being an addition to the NavBar - is a distinct page, and the Contact Us and Feedback page can be combined cleanly.

There are (in my opinion) a lot of problems with accidental inclusions, grammar, phrasing, and design choices. 
I'll list them all: 

  - Global: The steel diamond pattern seems like its missing the mark somehow, logo is too minimalist

  - Home: Margin-Top on page display bar, "... is to" 

  - Services: "posses(s)", "are able  to", redundant hyperlink in last  paragraph, "...engineer: <mailto>Design_quote</mailto>", random button placement
  
  - Products: "\", "tu" at footer, random spaces everywhere

  - Search: Margin-Top on header image, it's broken

  - Contact Us:

  - About Us: 

  - Feedback: Redundant "... if you provide us contact info ...", clear form button

```

```
